    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I’m Varun Saxena, an incoming software engineer at NTT Technocross, Japan, with a BTech from IIT Guwahati, India, passionate about building robust digital solutions. Previously, I’ve architected secure remote access systems at NTT Technocross in Japan and developed scalable microservices at Jio Platforms Ltd. As Web Operations Head for Spirit 2023, I led a 15+ member team to deliver tech that powered Northeast India’s largest college sports festival.

    My experience spans hands-on work from full-stack web development to micro-patterning techniques for next-gen microfabrication, blending software with emerging technology. On the side, I also dive into finance, making short films and appreciating cinematography. Let’s connect and build something innovative!
